To create cloudfunction job which triggers dataflow job the following was done

1) create dataflow job and test it
2) open google shell terminal
3) git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates.git
4) cd v1
5) on this page https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/blob/main/v1/README_GCS_Text_to_BigQuery.md
6) run mvn clean install -pl plugins/templates-maven-plugin -am
7) fill project id and bucket name and thhen run the below command
export PROJECT=<my-project>
export BUCKET_NAME=<bucket-name>

mvn clean package -PtemplatesStage  \
-DskipTests \
-DprojectId="$PROJECT" \
-DbucketName="$BUCKET_NAME" \
-DstagePrefix="templates" \
-DtemplateName="GCS_Text_to_BigQuery" \
-f v1
8) check the bucket to make sure the template has been built
9) prepare cloud function locally
10) open cloud function console. by default it uses 2nd gen environment
11) make sure all relevant APIs are enabled. Also enable eventarc receiver and sender role permission for your project's service account
12) enter a function name and select the cloud storage trigger type
13) select the appropriate event type and also the bucket which will be used to store dataflow artefacts
14) in runtime, build settings, select the smallest number of max instances and increase the timeout
15) use the default runtime service account or your own. if the default is chosen make sure the appropriate event arc roles have their permissions set
16) click next, and select the appropriate runtime - python3.8 and paste your locally developed code. enter the function name
17) add the libraries to the requirements.txt file
18) deploy the function
19) once successfully deployed. upload new file to storage bucket. check the dataflow dashboard to make sure the job has ran successfully
20) go to biguqery dashboard and check if the dataset has been correctly created (make sure the dataset and table are present or it maynot
be necessary to create the table after all; this is taken care of by the dataflow job as you would have specified the schema)
